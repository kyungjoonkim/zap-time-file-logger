# zap-time-file-logger

I created this because it seemed like there was no option to generate log files by date when using the zap Logger.
The usage is very simple, as shown below.

```go
zapcore.AddSync(&rolling.TimeFileLogger{
    PrefixFileName:     "xxxx/you-log-file-name",
    TimeFormat:         "2006-01-02",
    LogRetentionPeriod: 10 * 24 * time.Hour,
    MaxSize:            300,
})
```

When used as above, log files will be generated by date in the form of xxxx/you-log-file-name-2020-01-01-0.log.

### PrefixFileName: 
- Specifies the path and prefix of the log file name. (xxxx/you-log-file-name) 

### TimeFormat: 
- Specifies the format in which the date will be displayed in the log file name. Uses the time format defined in the time package. 

### LogRetentionPeriod:
- The log file deletion period. 10 * 24 * time.Hour (10 days). Files older than 10 days from the creation date will be deleted.

### MaxSize:
- The maximum size of the log file. A new file will be created if it exceeds 300MB.
